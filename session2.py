Problem 1: Transpose Matrix
Write a function transpose() that accepts a 2D integer array matrix and returns the transpose of matrix. 
The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over its main diagonal, swapping the rows and columns.

Problem 5: Container with Most Honey
Christopher Robin is helping Pooh construct the biggest hunny jar possible. Help his write a function that accepts an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most honey.

Return the maximum amount of honey a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Problem 2: Two-Pointer Palindrome
Write a function is_palindrome() that takes in a string s as a parameter 
and returns True if the string is a palindrome and False otherwise. 
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabetic characters.

The function must use the two-pointer approach,
 which is a common technique in which we initialize two variables 
 (also called a pointer in this context) to track different indices or places in a list or string, 
 then moves the pointers to point at new indices based on certain conditions. 
 In the most common variation of the two-pointer approach, 
 we initialize one variable to point at the beginning of a list 
 and a second variable/pointer to point at the end of list.
 We then shift the pointers to move inwards through the list towards each other, 
 until our problem is solved or the pointers reach the opposite ends of the list.

Insert new_interval into intervals such that intervals is still sorted in ascending order by starti and intervals still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).
